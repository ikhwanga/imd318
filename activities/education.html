          <h5>PRIMARY SCHOOL SEKOLAH KEBANGSAAN BUKIT PINANG</h5>
          <p>
            Sekolah Kebangsaan Bukit Pinang (SKBP) was established at the beginning of 1982. Initially this school was a branch of Sekolah Kebangsaan Titi Gajah, with a capacity of six classrooms (one class for each stream) that housed a total of 211 students. The supervising teacher in charge at that time was Mr. Othman Ahmad. He was assisted by Pn. Hajjah Che Pah bt. Dean. They are both individuals who are responsible for ensuring that the school runs smoothly. Mrs. Hajjah Che Pah is willing to spend her own pocket money to buy school supplies such as chalk, erasers and the like for teaching and learning in the classroom. The number of teachers at that time consisted of seven people (2 males and 5 females)..
          </p>
          <p>
            By 1985, the number of students had reached up to 400 people. On the efforts of Mr. Mohd. Hassan Hamid, a mutual aid project was held to cover the needs of the classroom at that time. This project is funded by donations from individuals, heirs and teachers. As a result, a one-story building containing four classrooms has been successfully erected. This new building block was inaugurated by YAB Dato' Seri Hj. Osman Arof, Chief Minister of Kedah Darul Aman on 20 July 1987.
On December 31, 2001, this school received an allocation of RM2.1 million from the government to add two new three-storey building blocks that are able to accommodate the needs of students that are increasing from time to time. Construction work began on January 1, 2002 and by August 31, 2002, the building was fully completed and optimally utilized..

          <h5>SECONDARY SCHOLL AT MAKTAB MAHMUD POKOK SENA</h5>
          <p>
            Maktab Mahmud or Al-Maahad Al-Mahmud is a Religious School under the patronage of the Sultan of Kedah. Academic learning and the al-Azhar syllabus are taught here. There have been many Mahmud College branches throughout Kedah. Its main location is in Alor Star, Kedah. Its motto is 'Al-Ilmu Nur'.



Maktab Mahmud was established on Friday 29 Rabiul Awal 1355 H corresponding to 19 June 1936 AD. The laying of the foundation stone was completed by DYMM Tunku Mahmud Ibni Al Marhum Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin Mukarramul Shah, Regent and President State and Council of Kedah. Maktab Mahmud was then officially opened by His Majesty Sultan Abdul Hamid Halim Shah, the Sultan of Kedah Darulaman at that time.



His Majesty's main purpose is to make it a center for the spread of Islam, the Arabic language and produce religious figures. In addition, His Majesty thinks that the State of Kedah needs Islamic Colleges comparable to English schools at that time, the education system uses the Egyptian education system (Al-Azhar)..
          </p>
          <p>
            This college is administered by an Advisory Committee appointed with the approval of the Sultan of Kedah. The Menteri Besar is usually the Chairman of the Advisory Committee and the College Headmaster as the Secretary. The committee is appointed from Islamic scholars and sheikuls and its administrative authority lies under the authority of the Kedah Islamic Religious Affairs office.



            Maktab Mahmud's contribution gave birth to the figures of the independence struggle against the Malayan Union by establishing the Kedah Ulama Association on February 9, 1946, which succeeded in uniting the entire Kedah ulama against the Malayan Union.
            
            
            
            Maktab Mahmud is fully funded by the Kedah Darulaman State Government and patronized by the Sultan of Kedah. Maktab Mahmud only consisted of male students from the beginning of its establishment until December 31, 1972. Sekolah Agama Tarbiah Islamiah, Jalan Pegawai was merged with Maktab Mahmud and consolidated under the administration of the Mahmud College Board according to the Mahmud College Board Enactment 1967. The established board is responsible for managing affairs- administrative affairs, finance, services, education and others. Starting from the unification, Maktab Mahmud has opened up educational opportunities for female students.
            
            The establishment of 11 Maktab Mahmud in 11 districts in Kedah symbolizes the commitment of the state government in dignifying Islamic religious education in Kedah and ensuring that its people get a perfect education..
