            Friendship is the hardest thing in the world to explain. It's not something you learn in school. But if you haven't learned the meaning of friendship, you really haven't learned anything." â€” Muhammad Ali.

          <h5>FRIENDS ARE THE SIBLINGS GOD NEVER GAVE US." - Mencius</h5>
          <p>
            Everyone goes through stressful events. If you know you have people you can count on, you may be less likely to even perceive a tough time as stressful. 

            Spending time with friends can also help reduce stress. According to Harvard Medical School, "social connections help relieve levels of stress, which can harm the heart's arteries, gut function, insulin regulation, and the immune system."6
            
            Friends can also help you cope with stressful situations. According to one small study, when children hang out with their friends during a stressful situation, they produce less cortisol, a hormone released when the body is under stress.7.

          <p>
            While we might all be pretty good at building online communities, our in person ones are seriously lacking. When we invest the energy in our friendships, and then encourage our friends to be friends with each other it fosters a sense of community..

          <h5>BROTHERHOOD CIRCLE</h5>
          <p>
            Joining a sorority or fraternity leads to lifelong relationships and unending support from your new sisters and brothers. Thus women and men will embody the true sense of the words sisterhood and brotherhood. They will be the ones to stay up to study with you, sit and talk to you when you need advice, help you deal with tough times, and laugh with you when life smiles down on you. The meaning of sisterhood and brotherhood will not only encompass what these individuals will do for you, but what you will be able to contribute to the chapter as a unique individual..
